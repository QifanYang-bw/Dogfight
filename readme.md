- The current code serves as a demonstration of a single plane (with tons of bug). This is the current usable part of the code.

To run the code, type
```
$ python3 interface.py
```

Change the playerlist array in const.py to switch player.

Keyboard settings for player 1:
- Arrow keys for direction control
- Comma(,) for fire

Keyboard settings for player 2:
- WASD for direction control
